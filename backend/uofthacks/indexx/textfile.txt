Idk if I've talked about this before but everytime the bell ring signalling us to go to our next class I get anxiety. Walking through the school to get to my next class causes me to not feel my legs while walking or my legs will feel stiff.
This has been happening to me since 2015 and people tell me that I walk weird and I blame my stupid anxiety.
If this continues til my college years I will feel the worse. I don't need new people to know about my anxiety. Idk what to do to stop getting anxious. I've tried listening to music or thinking of other things but I continue walking weird. By weird I mean I'll jump while walking or walk super slouched.
At first I would only get anxiety while walking at school but now I get it while walking at a store. I wished this would just end !
I woke u tired this morning and I didn't like it. I finished my 5 page essay which took me a whole week to finish. I did procrastinate and I think it was because I'm so used to writing 2 pages. My day went alright and I didn't feel sleepy until 6th pd (period). I was so sad because I got sleepy like very sleepy and it made it difficult for me to move.
This is the fourth time I have moved. I feel like with every time that I move I become less messier. The first time I moved my whole room was filled with stuff that I needed to unpack and would take me days to finish. Now I don't have much stuff in the room and I think I can finish today. Every time I move I sit in the floor near the door and I just noticed haha... 3-30-2018
I remember the first time texting he told me he was clingy when he liked someone and I told him I was perfectly fine with that and it wouldn't bother me. For the first few months whenever I would send him a msg he would reply seconds later. Now he takes one or two days to reply back to me. When he comes back he tells me 'I'm sorry I was busy' I don't think this is true, but I don't have proof. He told me he was clingy but now it's the opposite.
This sounds like I'm always on my phone, but that is not true and I want to know why he takes days to reply. This makes me so sad. I also remember when we were first talking he told me that he didn't have any parents because they died and he lives with his grandma, but a few weeks ago he was talking to me about his mother and after that I just don't trust him. I never fully trusted him because of past things and I only had partial trust in him but now it's nothing.
I don't know what to think anymore.....
Today I was making myself some food to eat and my sister was there. I don't know why I felt so much anger towards her. Looking at her made me so mad, but I didn't yell at her or was rude and pretended to feel normal.
She decided to eat with me and tried to make conversation with me, but I just couldn't talk much and tried so hard to act normal.
Today I got picked up early from school and I drove for about 2 hours which was fun. The reason I got picked up was because I just wanted to.
I got a Starbucks drink which was very delicious and I was happy. (:
Tomorrow I have an AP Government test and I hope I pass.
Tomorrow is my last full day at school and then I'm off for Thanksgiving break! (: thank god because I needed a break from school.
Tomorrow I'm not going to my lunch break and will go to the library. I really don't feel happy to go to lunch. I feel sad because I feel left out. ): I will try to get my letter of recommendation done so I can hand one to my teacher before we're off for break.
I hope tomorrow goes out good!
Ok so first off, several stuff has been bothering me but I try to stay cool.
My family and I went out to go eat a someone's place and one of my ladies and some other girl kept staring at me. That shit was very annoying and it made me feel awkward.
We were at that place for so many hours that I was already very bored and sleepy.
